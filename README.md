# GraphQL::Schema::Directive::Constraint

Allows using @constraint as a directive to validate input data for [graphql-ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org).

This gem is greatly inspired by [confuser/graphql-constraint-directive](https://github.com/confuser/graphql-constraint-directive)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql-schema-directive-constraint'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install graphql-schema-directive-constraint
```

## Usage

Specify `GraphQL::Schema::Directive::Constraint` with parameter to `directive` arguments in `argument`

```ruby
class LengthInput < GraphQL::Schema::InputObject
  argument :arg, String,
    directives: {
      GraphQL::Schema::Directive::Constraint => {
        minLength: 3,
        maxLength: 5,
        pattern: '[0-9a-zA-Z]*$',
      },
    }
end
```

This `LengthInput` example will generates definition as below:

```graphql
input LengthInput {
  arg: String! @constraint(minLength: 3, maxLength: 5, pattern: "[0-9a-zA-Z]*$")
}
```

This example generates [Validators](https://graphql-ruby.org/fields/validation.html) to validates input.
You can disable generate validator with `without_validator` argument like below:

```ruby
field :without_validator, String, null: false do
  argument :input, String, directives: {
    GraphQL::Schema::Directive::Constraint => {
      pattern: '^[a-z]+$',
      without_validator: true,
    }
  }
end
```

This example only generates `@constraint` directive on schema but it does not validates input variable.
